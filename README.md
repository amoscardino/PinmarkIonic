# Pinmark (Ionic Framework)

This repo contains the source for a (really) simple Pinboard client built using [Ionic Framework](https://ionicframework.com) (with React). This is intended as a demonstration of Ionic and as a comparison with a [similar repo built using React Native](https://github.com/amoscardino/PinmarkReactNative).

## Set Up

Make sure you have the Ionic CLI installed:

```bash
npm install -g @ionic/cli
```

Then clone the repo and run `npm install` in the directory.

## Running

- To run in the browser, use `ionic serve`
- To run on iOS, use `ionic cap run ios`
  - You can also add `-lc` to enable console output and live-reload.
- Android is not included in the repo, but you can [follow the instructions in the official docs](https://ionicframework.com/docs/developing/android) to try it.
